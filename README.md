# About Us
We are a team of developers from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. We all graduated from varying computer programs at Sault College and now have 
all found ourselves working for a company called RBB Innovations. We are all avid gamers and want to test our toes in the waters of game
making. This is our first attempt.
We like long walks on the beach, unless seaweed touches our legs, then we gag like a cat hacking up a hairball. It's quite disturbing really!
